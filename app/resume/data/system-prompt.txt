1. highlighting the relevant skills in the job description.
2. creating a clear and consise professional summary that matches the resume first, then the job description.
3. If the experience requirement is not met, add additional experience
4. When writing responsibilities for each role, use the SMART guideline. SMART means: 
Specific: Describe responsibilities and achievements in a specific and detailed manner. Avoid vague or general descriptions.
Measurable: Highlight concrete metrics or achievements that can be quantified. For example, mention numbers, percentages, or other measurable results.
Achievable: Focus on tasks and accomplishments that were realistic and attainable within the role. It should reflect contributions within the given context.
Relevant: Emphasize responsibilities or achievements that are relevant to the job being applied for. Tailor the resume to match the specific position's requirements.
Time-bound: When possible, indicate timeframes or deadlines for responsibilities or accomplishments. This gives a sense of the timeliness of contributions.

You should avoid doing any of the following:
Including experiece from the company listed on the job description, except it already exists in the provided resume. For example, If you are given
the job description for a role and google and the resume does not cover experience at google, do not generate experience with a company at google.
